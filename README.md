# 👋 Hi, I'm Filipe Chau

**Electronic & Telecommunication Engineer | Data Center & Access Control Specialist | Aspiring Senior Engineer**

I'm a Mozambican engineer with a strong background in **data center operations**, **access control systems**, and **electronic security**, particularly in high-stakes environments like **Mozambique LNG** and **Movitel at Maputo Main Station**.

🔐 Over the last few years, I've worked in critical operations across sectors such as Oil & Gas and Telecommunications, ensuring secure, high-availability infrastructure.

🧠 I'm currently working toward a **senior-level engineering role** by combining my hands-on field expertise with continuous learning in **Python** and **Cloud computing**.
